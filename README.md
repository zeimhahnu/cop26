## Data sources

**CO2 Emissions** Emissions data is taken from the Global Carbon Project ([Friedlingstein et al., 2020 : The Global Carbon Budget 2020, Earth System Science Data](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/3269/2020/))

**Income Group Classification** The classification of countries into income groups is taken from the [World Bank](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html)

**GHG emissions by sector** Data on greenhouse gas emissions is from the [World Resource Institute](https://www.wri.org/data/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2016) - published 2020, but data displayed is from 2016.

**Deforestation by year** Yearly deforestation data was downlaoded from [Global Forest Watch](globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/global/)

**Deforestation by decade / region and protected forest proportion** All other forest data taken from the FAO report ["Global Forest Resources Assessment" (2020)](https://www.fao.org/3/ca9825en/ca9825en.pdf), pages 13, 14, 15

**Temperature anomaly** Temperature data was taken from several sources. For the *global* temperature anomaly, [NOAA's Global Land and Ocean Temperature Anomalies](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/global/time-series) was used. 

**Sea level rise**

**Artic sea ice** The information on the extent of Artic sea ice was taken from the [National Snow and Ice Data Center / Nasa Earth Observatory](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index)

**Fossil fuel consumption over time**Data on fossil fuel consumption was gathered from [BP's Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2018-full-report.pdf). The data file for 2018 included a time series on fossil fuel consumption; we checked against more recent datasets to double-check validity and upon a match decided to use the time series, adding shares for more recent data.

**Coal-fired power plants by region** [Global Coal Plant tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TmGMtqoUnUlxQ0Z8kDwBob5nV-W4Y2EWwgrq2RE3yR8/edit#gid=0) maintained by the Global Energy Monitor.

**Heating technology sales** data was downloaded from [IEA](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/heating-technology-sales-in-the-sustainable-development-scenario-2010-2030)

**Eletricity generation by energy type** [BP's Statistical Review of World Energy 2021](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html)

**Electric vehicle sales** were taken from [IEA](https://www.iea.org/articles/global-ev-data-explorer), selecting "sales" and "cars" as variables. We used sale shares from [BloombergNEF](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/peak-internal-combustion-engine-may-already-be-years-behind-us) to compute the total amount of vehicles sold.

**Investment in energy supply by sector** was taken from [IEA's 2021 report on World Energy Investment (page 7)](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/5e6b3821-bb8f-4df4-a88b-e891cd8251e3/WorldEnergyInvestment2021.pdf)
